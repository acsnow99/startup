Today we did a GitHub assignment, and I learned how simple merge conflicts can be to solve. Merge conflicts always feel scary because it's almost like Git itself is telling you something is wrong with your code or with your process. That doesn't seem to be the case. Merge conflicts can actually be quite simple.

Today I set up my server on AWS. I learned how to SSH into the server using a private key. Even though we won't be using that very much in the course, it helps me feel in control of my own server. I also learned how to set up an instance that has a static IP address. I've worked with AWS before, so I know how convenient a static IP is.

Today I got HTTPS working on my server. What a good feeling! I've had my own website before, but only through services like website builders (Weebly, etc) and Netlify. I really like having complete control of how my webiste looks to the internet, even being able to set up subdomains. I learned that Let's Encrypt is even easier than I thought; it's just as simple as using a service that has Let's Encrypt compatibility built in. I like it!
