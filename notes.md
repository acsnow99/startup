Today we did a GitHub assignment, and I learned how simple merge conflicts can be to solve. Merge conflicts always feel scary because it's almost like Git itself is telling you something is wrong with your code or with your process. That doesn't seem to be the case. Merge conflicts can actually be quite simple.

Today I set up my server on AWS. I learned how to SSH into the server using a private key. Even though we won't be using that very much in the course, it helps me feel in control of my own server. I also learned how to set up an instance that has a static IP address. I've worked with AWS before, so I know how convenient a static IP is.
